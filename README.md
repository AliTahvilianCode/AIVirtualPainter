Hand Detector - Virtual Drawing & Erasing

This project implements a hand detection system that allows users to write and erase with their hand in real time using a webcam. It leverages OpenCV, Mediapipe, and NumPy to track hand movements and provide an interactive drawing experience.

Features

Hand Tracking: Uses Mediapipe's Hand Tracking module to detect hand landmarks.

Virtual Writing: Draw on the screen by moving your finger.

Virtual Erasing: Erase drawn content using specific hand gestures.

Smooth Drawing: Implements stabilization for better drawing experience.

Efficient Processing: Optimized for real-time performance.
